RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) is a protocol that allows for live streaming video over the internet, while RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) is more focused on audio. For live streaming on YouTube, you'll typically use RTMP to connect your camera to their servers. Some cameras come with built-in support for RTMP, which makes setup easier. (Explorative question from the user)\nU: Can I stream live video to YouTube using a traditional security camera? \n\nS: Unfortunately, most traditional security cameras don't have the capabilities to stream live video directly to YouTube without some extra setup and configuration.

(Explorative question from the user)\nU: What's the difference between streaming live video to YouTube and recording it? \n\nS: When you stream live video to YouTube, it means that the video is being broadcast in real-time as it's happening. This allows your viewers to watch the video as it unfolds. On the other hand, when you record a video, it's stored on your camera or computer for later viewing. You can also choose to both stream and record at the same time! \n\nS: Based on what we've discussed, I think the StarDot NetCamLIVE2 YouTube Live Stream Camera Bundle might be a great option for you!

And I'm not sure about the fabric - is there a difference between polyester and cotton? \n\nS: Yes, there are some differences! Polyester is generally more durable and easier to clean than cotton, but it can be less breathable. Cotton, on the other hand, is often preferred for its natural texture and absorbency. Some blackout curtains also have thermal insulation properties.\nU: That's interesting. I didn't know that. So which type of fabric would you recommend? \n\nS: Well, it depends on your specific needs! If you're looking for something easy to clean and durable, polyester might be the way to go.

But I'm not sure if it's exactly what I'm looking for. Can you tell me more about Pyrex Bakeware? What makes it so special? \n\nS: Sure thing! Pyrex Bakeware is a well-known brand that has been making high-quality glass bakeware for decades. Their products are known for being durable, heat-resistant, and easy to clean. They also have a nice weight to them, which makes them feel substantial in your hands.\nU: That sounds great. I'd like to learn more about Pyrex Bakeware. Can you tell me about the differences between tempered glass and other types of glass? \n\nS: Absolutely! Tempered glass is made by heating glass to extremely high temperatures and then rapidly cooling it. This process makes the glass stronger and more resistant to thermal shock, which means it can withstand sudden changes in temperature without breaking.\nU: That's really interesting! I had no idea that tempered glass was so durable. So, what other types of glass are there? \n\nS: Well, there's also borosilicate glass, which is another type of heat-resistant glass. However, Pyrex Bakeware uses tempered glass instead of borosilicate glass for their products.\nU: Okay, I think I'm starting to get a better understanding of the different types of glass out there. But what about safety? Are Pyrex Bakeware pie plates safe to use? \n\nS: Yes, absolutely! Pyrex Bakeware pie plates are made with tempered glass that is designed to be safe for use in the oven, microwave, and freezer. They also have a non-porous surface that prevents stains and odors from accumulating.\nU: That's great to hear! I'd like to try out a Pyrex Bakeware pie plate for myself. Can you recommend one specifically? \n\nS: Yes, based on what we've discussed, I would recommend the Pyrex 6001003 Glass Bakeware Pie Plate 9\" x 1.2\" Pack of 2, 5.2, Clear.
