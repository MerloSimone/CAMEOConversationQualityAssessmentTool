RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) is a protocol that allows for live streaming video over the internet, while RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) is more focused on audio. For live streaming on YouTube, you'll typically use RTMP to connect your camera to their servers. Some cameras come with built-in support for RTMP, which makes setup easier.

(Explorative question from the user)\nU: What's the difference between streaming live video to YouTube and recording it? \n\nS: When you stream live video to YouTube, it means that the video is being broadcast in real-time as it's happening. This allows your viewers to watch the video as it unfolds. On the other hand, when you record a video, it's stored on your camera or computer for later viewing. You can also choose to both stream and record at the same time! \n\nS: Based on what we've discussed, I think the StarDot NetCamLIVE2 YouTube Live Stream Camera Bundle might be a great option for you!
