Would you like to explore the different subtopics within anglo-irish literature, such as the 18th century or modern Irish writing?\nU: Hmm, I'm not sure. I've heard of some famous authors like Jonathan Swift and Oscar Wilde, but I'd love to learn more about their work. \n\nS: Ah, great choices! Jonathan Swift is indeed a notable figure in anglo-irish literature. His satire and wit are still widely read today. Oscar Wilde's works also have a unique style that blends humor and social commentary. What would you like to know more about?

How did it develop over time, and what influenced the writers during that period? \n\nS: That's a great question! The development of anglo-irish literature was shaped by the cultural and social climate of Ireland and Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Irish language and tradition played a significant role in shaping the work of writers like Swift, Wilde, and others.

While English was the dominant Irish literary language in the 20th century, much high-quality work appeared in Irish.\nU: That's fascinating! I'd love to learn more about the different traditions and influences within anglo-irish literature. \n\nS: Let me tell you more about a book that might interest you: \"Ascendancy and Tradition in Anglo-Irish Literary History from 1789 to 1939\". It explores the cultural significance of this period through an examination of central texts and concepts. Beginning with Burke's correspondence and Reflections, it goes on to discuss Maria Edgeworth's fiction, the political vocabulary of T.D. Gregg and E.W. Gladstone, Celticism, the drama and poetry of Yeats, and Joyce's oeuvre as a whole.\nU: That sounds incredibly comprehensive!
