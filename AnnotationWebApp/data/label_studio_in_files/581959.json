I'd love to include some historical context, as well as personal stories and photos. \n\nS: Okay! That sounds like a great approach. Have you thought about what kind of format you might use for your family chronicle? Would you want it to be a physical book, or maybe something digital?\nU: Honestly, I'm not sure.
