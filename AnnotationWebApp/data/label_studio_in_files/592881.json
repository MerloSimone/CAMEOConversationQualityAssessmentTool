So what's the most important thing I should look for when choosing an acrylic brush? \n\nS: First and foremost, consider the quality of the bristles. A good acrylic brush should have soft, flexible bristles that will hold liquid well and allow you to create smooth, even strokes.\nU: That makes sense! What about the handle? Is it important too? \n\nS: Yes, a comfortable and easy-to-hold handle can make a big difference in your ability to work with the brush.
