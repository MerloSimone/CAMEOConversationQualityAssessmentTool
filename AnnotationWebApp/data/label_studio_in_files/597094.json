Tempered glass pie plates are perfect for baking and serving pies. What's your budget for this purchase?\nU: I'd say around $20-30 is my target range. I want something that will last me for a while, but also won't break the bank. \n\nS: Okay, in that case, you might want to consider Pyrex Bakeware 9-1/2-Inch Pie Plate, Clear.

Can you tell me about the differences between tempered glass and other types of glass? \n\nS: Absolutely! Tempered glass is made by heating glass to extremely high temperatures and then rapidly cooling it.

But what about safety? Are Pyrex Bakeware pie plates safe to use? \n\nS: Yes, absolutely! Pyrex Bakeware pie plates are made with tempered glass that is designed to be safe for use in the oven, microwave, and freezer.
