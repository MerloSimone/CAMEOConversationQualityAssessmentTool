And while Kyla faces some tough challenges, she also learns to trust herself and others along the way.\nU: That sounds encouraging. Can you tell me more about Kyla's background? What's her personality like? \n\nS: Sure! Kyla is a strong-willed and independent person who's been hurt by past experiences.
